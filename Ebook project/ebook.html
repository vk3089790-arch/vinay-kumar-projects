    <p class="content"><b><h2>Anime (アニメ) is a style of animation that originated in Japan and has grown into a global phenomenon. While it simply means "animation" in Japanese, outside of Japan, "anime" specifically refers to Japanese animated shows and films.

Anime spans a wide variety of genres, art styles, and target audiences—from lighthearted comedies to deep philosophical dramas, from children’s adventures to mature, psychological thrillers.

🎨 Origins and Evolution
🎥 Early History

Anime’s roots trace back to the early 20th century. One of the first notable Japanese animations was “Namakura Gatana” (The Dull Sword) in 1917. However, anime as we know it today started to take shape in the 1960s, led by Osamu Tezuka, often called the “God of Manga.” His work, such as Astro Boy, laid the foundation for modern anime aesthetics and storytelling.

📺 Global Boom
In the 1980s and 90s, anime exploded in popularity both domestically and internationally, with titles like:

Dragon Ball Z

Sailor Moon

Neon Genesis Evangelion

Pokémon

These series brought anime into households around the world and introduced a new generation to Japanese culture, art, and storytelling.</b></h2>

Creating an anime series is a complex, collaborative process that involves many stages:

1. Planning & Scriptwriting

Every anime starts with a concept. It might come from:

A manga or light novel

An original script by a writer

A game or other existing media

Producers decide the format (TV series, movie, OVA), budget, and target audience.

2. Storyboarding & Design

Directors and artists create storyboards—rough visual scenes—and develop:

Character designs

Backgrounds

Color palettes

Scene composition

3. Animation

Studios use a combination of traditional hand-drawn art and digital animation. Key animators draw the major poses, and in-between animators fill the gaps.

4. Voice Acting (Seiyuu)

Japan's voice acting industry is massive. Seiyuu are often celebrities in their own right, with dedicated fanbases.</h2></p>
